This is a small set of Flask APIs that stores and finds categories of questions. It uses spaCY's natural language processing capabilities to find a category and sentence match for a given query string parameter.

Usage:
  * Run the bash script to start the Flask server and go to the local address in your browser
  * Choose which API you would like to use via the URL
  * Enter inputs via query string
